# PulseAI Compute Agents

**Decentralized AI Compute Orchestration on Nosana**

## Overview
PulseAI Compute Agents is a decentralized AI execution and orchestration system built on top of Nosana’s GPU marketplace. The project enables developers, startups, DAOs, and researchers to run real-world AI workloads—such as inference and lightweight fine-tuning—using decentralized GPU resources instead of centralized cloud providers.

## Problem
Access to high-performance GPU compute is expensive, centralized, and restrictive. Most AI builders rely on cloud providers that introduce vendor lock-in, opaque pricing, regional limitations, and single points of failure. This limits experimentation, innovation, and global access to AI infrastructure.

## Solution
PulseAI introduces an agent-based system that dynamically deploys AI workloads to Nosana’s decentralized GPU network. Intelligent agents manage job scheduling, GPU selection, execution, and result delivery based on cost, availability, and performance. This provides a scalable, censorship-resistant, and cost-efficient alternative for AI compute.

## How It Uses Nosana
- **Primary Compute Layer**: Nosana GPU marketplace serves as the backbone.
- **Agent Dispatch**: AI agents dispatch inference and fine-tuning jobs to Nosana GPU nodes.
- **Real Workloads**: GPU credits are used for LLMs, embeddings, vision, and speech tasks.
- **Metrics**: Performance and execution metrics are tracked per job.
- **Delivery**: Results are returned via APIs and Web3-compatible endpoints.

This directly drives GPU demand and demonstrates Nosana’s capability to power production-grade AI applications.

## Innovation
- Agent-based decentralized GPU orchestration.
- Real-world AI workloads running on decentralized infrastructure.
- Cloudless AI execution without centralized dependencies.
- Reusable infrastructure for other builders in the Nosana ecosystem.

## Long-Term Vision
PulseAI aims to become a foundational decentralized AI execution layer for Web3 and open-source AI builders. Over time, it will offer APIs, SDKs, and reference implementations that make Nosana-powered AI accessible to both Web2 and Web3 developers.
